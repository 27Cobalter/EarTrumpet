Ear Trumpet is a volume control app for Windows. Frustrated with the lack of volume controls for Modern apps in Windows 8, 8.1 and 10, we created Ear Trumpet. The app was quickly expanded to also allow the control of Windows Desktop apps.

To show Windows Desktop apps, right-click the Ear Trumpet icon in the tray and click Show Desktop Apps.
